### Hobbies and Interests:
Apart from writing code, I am also interested in writing blog. I have two personal blogs. smallintro.com where I write about small introduction about various technologies and another one is smallpaisa.com for sharing my financial knowledge.
Both of my blogs have the same theme template which I have customized to learn HTML and CSS.
