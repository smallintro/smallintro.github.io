## Hello World,

I am Sushil Prasad, a software engineer from India. I have more than 9 years of experience working with various technologies related to Java and Python.
I write most of my code in Java and Python programming language. Here is the link to my [github demo projects](https://www.github.com/smallintro).
Apart from writing code, I am also interested in writing blog. I have two personal blogs. smallintro.com where I write about small introduction about various technologies and another one is smallpaisa.com for sharing my financial knowledge.
I have created this github page as an sample page for my blog post [how to create website using github pages](https://www.smallintro.com/2020/09/create-your-free-website-with-github.html).
Both of my blogs have the same theme template which I have customized to learn HTML and CSS.
